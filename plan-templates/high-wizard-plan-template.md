## **EXECUTION LOG**
**Execution Protocol for AI**:
I have to use this document as my **ONLY** source of truth to execute and track the plan steps iteratively. I should **NOT** use additional tools like ToDos because it lacks the context of what should I do. Everytime I want to implement a step I have to check the reference to the original step plan above. Everytime a step has been finished I need to go back to this document to log what was done.
*In other words*:
- I have to make this document as the source of truth for the implementation phase on what I have worked on and what I will be working
- The original plan must be fully in my context, therefore, I have to make sure I loaded the **Plan File** before executing any task and read carefully the reference to the original step
- I have to do the implementation by doing it in order per step THEN, I ALWAYS have to fill the step log rightly after

**Definition of Done (applies to ALL steps)**:
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Code compiles/runs without errors
- ✅ **Testing**: Tests written and passing
- ✅ **Logged**: Implementation and testing logged below
- 🚫 **Blocked**: Get input from [USER-NAME] before assuming

---

## **POST-COMPLETION**
