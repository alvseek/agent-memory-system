"""Seam substitution — the reference implementation.

Each memory procedure carries one ``## Storage Mechanics`` section; serving/preview
swaps that section's body for a backend's ``## [procedure]`` section — markdown
mechanics for the native fleet, DB tools for Munnin. Pure text ops.

A procedure may also inline **components** (shared fragments), and a component can
reference storage ops of its own. Those are defined once under the component's own
``## [component]`` section rather than repeated under every procedure that inlines it;
``compose_backend_section`` assembles the procedure's section plus its components' into
the single body that gets substituted. A backend may also open **every** composed
procedure with one ``## all-procedures`` section — prose the whole backend owes each
procedure, such as what a placeholder its ops use means — again written once.

This is the framework's single home for that logic, defined once beside the seam
contract (``README.md``). It is Munnin-agnostic. Every consumer imports it:

- the standalone ``procedures/setup-scripts/compile-procedures.py`` preview tool (this repo);
- Munnin's ``ContentLoader`` + markdown-fidelity gate, which import this module
  from the checked-out submodule at runtime (Munnin keeps no copy of its own).
