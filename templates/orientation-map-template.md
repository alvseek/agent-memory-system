# Orientation Map — [project-name]

Index of orientation artifacts in this project. Used by agents at awakening (load into session context) and wrap-up (refresh entries the session touched) via the `/map-orientation` skill.

## Status Legend

- **useful** — current, accurate, future tasks will rely on it. Update when scope changes.
- **stale-but-valuable** — could be useful if updated. Repair on demand when next task hits its scope.
- **obsolete** — neither current nor valuable. Ignore. Optional: archive or delete.
- **unverified** — mtime changed since `last_verified`, or never verified. Next task touching its scope verifies and updates status.

## Scope Legend

- **shared** — relevant to every role on this project. Always loaded.
- **role-private** — relevant only to roles listed in `roles`. Other roles skip.
- **cross-readable** — relevant to roles listed in `roles`, PLUS Architect and QA always (cross-cutting roles read everything).

## Type Legend

- **7q-readme** — 7 Questions Framework README (any scope: root, module, sub-component)
- **architecture-map** — project-wide architecture navigation doc (ARCH-map.md style)
- **architecture-overview** — single-section architecture deep-dive (ARCH-overview, ARCH-domain-*, etc.)
- **flow-diagram** — Mermaid or similar diagram showing data/control flow (`.mmd`, `.mermaid`); the flow *deep-dive* altitude (`doc_type: flow`)
- **flow-journey-map** — the flow *map* altitude: how flows chain into journeys (`doc_type: flow-journey-map`, `docs/flows/journey-map.md`) from `/generate-flow-docs` bare
- **domain-model** — data-model / ERD doc: entities + relationships + cardinality (Mermaid `erDiagram` / `classDiagram`) from `/generate-domain-docs` (`doc_type: domain`, under `docs/domain/`)
- **domain-context-map** — the domain *map* altitude: how bounded contexts relate (DDD context map; `doc_type: domain-context-map`, `docs/domain/context-map.md`) from `/generate-domain-docs` bare
- **adr** — Architecture Decision Record (single decision document)
- **orientation-map-link** — pointer to a child orientation map for a sub-project (fractal scaling). The `child_map` field names the sub-map file.
- **other** — orientation artifact that doesn't fit above categories (CONTRIBUTING.md, GLOSSARY.md, etc.)

## Note on Creation

The agent who runs `/map-orientation create` for the first time scans ALL orientation docs in the project regardless of its own role. Creation is role-blind by necessity — the map must be complete for future agents of every role to filter against it. Role filtering applies at CONSUMPTION (which target docs each role actually reads), not creation.

## How to Use This File

**Agents at awakening**: Loaded into session context automatically by `/map-orientation` (bare call). Reference entries by `path` when consulting orientation docs for a task. The role-filter rules:

- Architect / QA → load + consult ALL entries (cross-cutting roles)
- Other roles → load + consult `scope: shared` + `scope: role-private/cross-readable` where your role is in the `roles` array

For `type: orientation-map-link` entries: if the entry passes the role filter, ALSO load the child map.

**Agents at wrap-up**: If your session updated any orientation doc, `/map-orientation --session-touched [paths]` updates its `last_verified` date and status. If your session DISCOVERED that an entry's status is wrong (useful doc is actually stale, obsolete doc is actually still valuable), update the entry directly via `/update-project-context`.

**Humans reviewing**: Spot-check `verified_by` and `update_trigger` fields. Spot-check `scope` and `roles` assignments — auto-guess from path heuristic may need correction.

## Customization Notes (delete after first fill)

- Example entries above demonstrate the schema with all scope/role/type combinations. Replace with this project's actual orientation artifacts.
- Add new entries as new orientation docs are created (via `/map-orientation --session-touched [new-path]`).
- Remove example entries that don't apply to this project.
- For monorepos with sub-projects: parent map references sub-maps via `type: orientation-map-link` entries. Sub-maps live in the same `context/` folder with suffix naming (`orientation-map-[subproject].md`).
- For projects with no role split (single-role projects like undanganaku, agent-memory framework): all entries get `scope: shared`, `roles: []`. Role filtering becomes a no-op.

## Localization (delete after first fill)

A **consenting** project can graduate its map + structural context into its own repo via [`/localize-context`](../procedures/localize-context.md) (see [ADR-005](../../docs/adr/2026-07-06-project-local-memory-externalization.md)). After graduation:

- The real map lives **in the project repo** at `<project-root>/docs/orientation-map.md` with frontmatter `source_of_truth: project`. Entry paths are **project-root-relative**.
- Structural context moves **flat** to `<project-root>/docs/` (no `context/` subfolder); the root `AGENTS.md` gets a prose pointer to the map.
- The **central** `shared-memory/[project]/context/orientation-map.md` becomes a thin **stub** with frontmatter `home: project` + `localized_path: docs/orientation-map.md`. It holds no real entries — it's the fleet breadcrumb + the machine-branch signal that [Localized Home Resolution](../procedures/localize-context.md#localized-home-resolution) keys off (resolved relative to the project cwd).
- **Two lanes** ([ADR-010](../../docs/adr/2026-07-13-work-product-memory-localization.md)): code-describing artifacts → `docs/` (this map + structural context); **work-product memory** (episodic + project-scoped knowledge) → `.agents/` (opt-in). **Identity** (reasoning / emotion / RAS), **general** knowledge, and business / relationship memory stay fleet-private and central.
